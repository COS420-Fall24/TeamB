##  Review / Quality Check Policy: <br/>
All team members shall have their deliverable work reviewed by another team member. This quality checking process should be conducted by another team member familiar with the work (e.g. doing similar work on that part) for efficiency, and distributed across the team. This quality checking should be complete at least 24 hours before any final review of the whole deliverable done by the team (e.g. before a team deliverable review meeting). This includes reviewing code / pull requests. <br/><br/>


### The person that did the task will assign a reviewer, by:<br/>
1) If no labels are assigned. Assign yourself to one with a Label to a task under the quality reviewer tab of the project section of the github task. The lablel will be a persons name
2) Open task in the GitHub Project Board to view the task guidelines and open relevant examples <br/>
3) The comment also has either: a) a couple sentences/bullet points on what was done, or b) “see assigned comments” then add comments on the document on the relevant parts and assign the comments to the reviewer <br/>+
4) Check the task description in the GitHub Project Board has the rubric information and/or grading comments that were addressed, so the reviewer knows what to check. If it’s missing, the person doing the task needs to add it. <br/>
5) After Quality Checking make sure to inculude The contributer % by following this model: Js 90 % / SA 10 %.  Used as an example to show qa Perceents may vary.   This is that the task was done by Jakob, or myself with Sebastian Qa'ing it.
6) Move the GitHub Project Board task to the Quality Checking Lane
<br/>
## The reviewer will review / quality check by: <br/>
1) Open task in the GitHub Project Board to view the task guidelines and open relevant examples <br/>
2) Open the work and compare to the task description and examples for quality and completeness <br/>
3) For revisions, looking at the edit history is very helpful to see what changed <br/>
4) Any questions about the reviewed work will be asked of the author in order to clarify any ambiguity or misconceptions, as comments on the GitHub Project Board task or document <br/>
5) Work that does not pass quality check will either be: a) fixed by the reviewer if the work is understandable and fixes are minor, or b) moved back to the In Progress lane and a comment added with what is not done/needs to be fixed (or questions) <br/>
6) After Quality Checking make sure to inculude The contributer % by following this model: Js 90 % / SA 10 %.  Used as an example to show qa Perceents may vary.   This is that the task was done by Jakob, or myself with Sebastian Qa'ing it.
7) Work that passes quality checks will be advanced on the GitHub Project Board; if the reviewer did work they should add a comment on the task with the rough percentage of the task they did/fixed<br/>

 Be friendly to your team in writing your comments and assume they did they best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. If there is an issue with a person doing work that needs lots of revisions, figure out the root causes via discussion e.g. at the sprint retrospective (root causes might include: knowledge, not seeking clarification, not looking at the examples before doing the work, someone with better knowledge should have been assigned the task or provided mentorship, etc).<br/><br/>

## Deadline Policy
 Deadlines will be based on the window of time for the assignment along with the number of tasks, Typically broken down into 3 periods, might be more if there is a lot of work for a deliverable. The last day will always be cut off and used Exclusively for either touchups or finalizing quality checking. For example lets say there is 20 tasks total, and 7 days to do the assignment. it will be 6 days for the assignment, and 15 tasks. Breaking it into thirds day 1-2 will be for the first set of tasks( for this case since there are 5 of us and we each have 3 tasks it will be 1 task for day 1-2 day 3-4 will be your second task and day 5-6 will be the third task.<br/><br/>

## Attendance Policy <br/>
 Life happens, if there are factors that make you miss a meeting it is all good. There will be a note document in each meeting and will be in the shared google drive for out team. So you can view and see what we did during the meeting. If there are things such as assigning tasks during the meeting and you are out, then you will be stuck with whatever is left.<br/><br/>

##  Communication Policy <br/>
 Official communication policy is: Discord will be the main form of communication. With @TeamB try to respond within 12 hours, if possible sooner. Try to only use @team if the entire team needs to see it. If you need to reach someone specifically, use @name, for example @Jakob Sholler try to respond to this within 12 hours as well if possible much sooner. And if there is something that desperately needs someone's attention you should direct message them. Try to save that as a last resort if possible.<br/><br/>
