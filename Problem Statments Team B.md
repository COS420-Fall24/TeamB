Team B:                                   Mission statement : To Simplify learning  
1\.	University students, particularly those in  STEM majors, are feeling overwhelmed, with their schedules becoming more packed every day, leaving little room for relaxation or enjoyment.  
With Ever changing and evolving technology students in STEM need to spend extra time learning the new technologies for their majors. New technologies such as Improved or new programs like Constantly Learning new technologies takes extra time out of those students' days leaving little time for other activities.   
Students in STEM majors are more often than not required to complete large projects along with large exams. Having large outside projects eats into the time STEM majors have dedicated to the rest of their life. Any other classwork/Homework, there is a Good chance that they have another class which Also requires Larger projects as well.  Any Work time from jobs, and as stated above, Time to learn the new Technologies in the field. So with all the above the time STEM students have their time cannibalized by school with little to no time for relaxation and enjoyment. A method to help combat this lack of time is time management.How can we help STEM majors manage their Time so that they get the breaks they need?

2	REPLACED(leaving on \#3 is the one being swapped to)  
**Most people** struggle to manage their time spent on digital devices and constant exposure to social media can lead to **further addiction**. To prevent this Setting Boundaries around Devices  can help Break addiction. Schools and workplaces could encourage digital detox programs to help reduce dependency.  

3\. Many starting programmers have difficulties reading and understanding code. This causes problems with learning and could lead to other issues such as imposter syndrome.Often learning materials focus on higher level Ideas, that causes those missing the foundational ideas to have a disconnect in understanding.  How can we simplify code to make it more readable and approachable for beginners?  
**Feedback and Changes tracker Table**

| Feedback From Instructor | Changes Made |
| :---- | :---- |
| Clarity /grammer (STEM) capitalization | All stem Changed to STEM as well as parts reworded to add better grammar/clarity |
| Missing the why large projects/exams cause lack of time  | Reworked paragraphs explained other sources that take their time away such as other classes with the same projects, or jobs, as well as a skill such as time management.  |
| Missing potential solution statement. | Added a potential solution as well as the question we are posing.  |
| Missing team name and coherent mission statement | Added both to the top of the document.  |
| Missing communication policies agendas list of meeting times | Added sections on github Page for team.  |
| \#2 Is not good use alternative Below said neurodivergent superpower( Seeing it on the list we decided to use beginner code reading instead)  | Made a new 2nd mission statement, should be \#3 issues, the problem, reason and symptoms of it, and  a question for how we can deal with it.  |

*Rubric:*

* 0.5 points for listing your team members' names and roles  
* 0.5 points for your team name and a coherent mission statement  
  * \-.5 this is missing  
* 3 points for a clear, concise, logically sound problem statement that defines:   
* the problem being solved  
  * \-1.7 see problem statements comments  
* its consequences in the world  
* the things that cause the problem  
* and why existing solutions don't resolve the problem  
* Points will be deducted for problem statements that are unclear, verbose, logically flawed, or present a solution.

\-1 missing all of: communication policies, agendas, listing of meeting times

As a reminder you can make 85% of the points back by taking the feedback and addressing it. To achieve that, fix the one problem statement above and submit a problem statement on helping low-income neurodiverse students in maine get a job in tech. â€œ*note: You're generally going to get lower grades than you are used to for the first submission for each project assignment. This can be a little scary but you make it back by responding and revising it, and basically all groups end up in the B and A range after revisions when they respond to feedback with revisions. On average that leads to higher than usual final grades generally.*
