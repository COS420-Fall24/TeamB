### 1.	University students particularly in stem majors, are feeling overwhelmed, with their schedules becoming more packed every day, leaving little room for relation or enjoyment.<b/>
With up and coming demand in the technology department, newer and better programs are coming out creating a hard time to balance and learn everything that is required of someone in that field<b/>
Students in stem majors are more often than not required to complete large projects along with large exams, creating lots of stress when incorporating all their stem classes.<b/>
### 2	
Most people struggle to manage their time spent on digital devices and constant exposure to social media can lead to further addiction. To prevent this Setting Boundaries around Devices  can help Break addiction. Schools and workplaces could encourage digital detox programs to help reduce dependency.
