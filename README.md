### 1. Stem Majors overwhelmed	
University students, particularly those in STEM majors, are feeling overwhelmed, with their schedules becoming more packed every day, leaving little room for relaxation or enjoyment. 
With Ever changing and evolving technology students in STEM need to spend extra time learning the new technologies for their majors. New technologies such as Improved or new programs like Constantly Learning new technologies takes extra time out of those students' days leaving little time for other activities. 
Students in STEM majors are more often than not required to complete large projects along with large exams. Having large outside projects eats into the time STEM majors have dedicated to rest of their life. Any other classwork/Homework, which there is a Good chance that they have another class which Also requires Larger projects as well. Any Work time from jobs, and as stated above, Time to learn the new Technologies in the field. So with all the above the time STEM students have their time cannibalized by school with little to no time for relaxation and enjoyment. A method to help combat this lack of time is time management.How can we help STEM majors manage their Time so that they get the breaks they need?

### 2	 Difficulties Reading Code
Many starting programmers have difficulties reading and understanding code. This causes problems with learning and could lead to other issues such as imposter syndrome.Often learning materials focus on higher level Ideas, that causes those missing the foundational ideas to have a disconnect in understanding. How can we simplify code to make it more readable and approachable for beginners?

## Communication policy <br/>
Official communication policy is: Discord will be the main form of communication. With @TeamB try to respond within 12 hours, if possible sooner. Try to only use @team if the entire team needs to see it. If you need to reach someone specifically, use @name, for example @Jakob Sholler try to respond to this within 12 hours as well if possible much sooner. And if there is something that desperately needs someone's attention you should direct message them. Try to save that as a last resort if possible.<br/> 

## Agenda <br/>
Thursdays are A weekly Sprint and End of Sprint meetings <br/>
Saturdays are The Other weekly sprint, and An Async scrum meeting after. <br/>
